<p>Database migrations require developers to carefully synchronize their object models and database schemas, which can become maddening, especially when switching git branches during development.
Is there a way to leverage the features from Scala and Slick to provide a convenient, minimal effort, reliable and safer migration process? The answer is yes. </p>
<p>In this talk I will demo Scala Forklift, a production-ready, type-safe database migration tool for Scala, developed in coordination with the Slick developers. The experimental git integration makes it easier to work with branches.</p>
